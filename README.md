# EnMasse e-mail
An application that sends multiple e-mails at a time, with support for a template containing placeholder text and replacing data from a data file. Attachments are also supported.

Please take a look at the [User Guide](https://github.com/AntonisTorb/EnMasse-email/blob/main/User%20Guide.pdf) before using the application, where you can find instructions on how to run the application and on the different options and settings. Three examples are also located in the [examples branch](https://github.com/AntonisTorb/EnMasse-email/tree/examples), with step-by-step instructions for each example, in order to get an idea of the flow.

If you discover any bugs or have an enhancement idea, feel free to open an issue, and if you wish to provide a solution as well, submit a pull request to the [alpha branch](https://github.com/AntonisTorb/EnMasse-email/tree/alpha).

Thank you!
